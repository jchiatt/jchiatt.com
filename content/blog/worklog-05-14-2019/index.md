Today, I spent a lot of time in Notion and meeting more of my new team members at [Echobind](https://echobind.com). I also spent some time thinking through how I might be able to help the community more over the next few months. ❤️

Tomorrow, I'll be volunteering at the [Mississippi Coding Academies](https://mscoding.org) by evaluating the students' final project presentations. Should be fun! I'll also work more on planning the next few months of opportunities at Echobind!

Today, [I was looking for a tool](https://twitter.com/jchiatt/status/1128318252071948288) that would let me have global search across services like Slack, Gmail, Twitter, etc. There's just too many places for conversations these days and I'm having trouble finding stuff! I learned about a tool called Shift, which seems to allow this. I haven't signed up yet, but I'm looking forward to checking it out! Will report back!
