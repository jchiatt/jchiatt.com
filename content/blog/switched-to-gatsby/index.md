Holy missing content, Batman! This blog has moved to Gatsby!

If you are looking for something that was on my old WordPress site, I'm sorry you've been disappointed! I'll be migrating posts over in the coming weeks.

In the meantime, if you need to get in touch with me, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jchiatt) is the best option!
