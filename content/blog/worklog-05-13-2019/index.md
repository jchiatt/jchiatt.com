Today was my first day at [Echobind](https://echobind.com), where I have joined as a Software Engineer & Growth Manager. Most of my day was getting acquainted with the company and meeting some of the team.

I'm SO excited about this position. I can't wait to work on things that help the community! I also am very excited to meet new people at the conferences they'll be sending me to this year. If you know me, be sure to come up and say hi!

So far, I'll probably be at these conferences, at least:

- [Refactr](https://refactr.tech) (I'm speaking!)
- [ChainReact](https://infinite.red/ChainReactConf)
- [React Rally](https://www.reactrally.com/)
- [Connect.tech](https://connect.tech)

Tomorrow I'll work on setting more thinga-ma-bobs up and meeting more people!
