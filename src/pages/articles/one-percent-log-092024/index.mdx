# 1% Better Log: September 20, 2024

As part of [my endeavor to incrementally improve my projects by 1% each day](/articles/one-percent-better-every-day), here's what I accomplished today:

| Project             | 1% Better Today? | How?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Grapple             | yes              | Uploaded yesterday's class footage to YouTube. Made several calls to raise attendance numbers for Mason Fowler seminar next week. Got a world-champion grappler to agree to review clips of my teaching periodically so I can improve at teaching jiu jitsu. |
| rafl                | yes              | Worked on data model! It's getting pretty close to what I'll use for the MVP, I think.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Personal Brand      | yes              | You're reading this post! Blogging is one part of my strategy to grow my personal brand over time.                                                                                                                                                           |

Time permitting after I get my children to bed tonight, I will work on improving Learn Arena and Dev Career Coaching by 1%. ðŸ’ª
