# 1% Better Log: September 25, 2024

As part of [my endeavor to incrementally improve my projects by 1% each day](/articles/one-percent-better-every-day), here's what I accomplished today:

| Project             | 1% Better Today? | How?                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Learn Arena         | yes              | Worked on a new strategy to figure out what's next for us. 
| DevLifts            | yes              | Started building an exercise assistant using a custom GPT.                                                                       |
| Dev Career Coaching | no               |                                                                                                                                  |
| Grapple             | yes              | Hosted Mason Fowler for a class and created a checklist to help students facilitate open mat/class in my absence.                |
| rafl                | no               |                                                                                                                                  |
| Personal Brand      | yes              | Set up a custom GPT to assist in outputting these 1% posts in the right format (it output this post!).                           |

Moving forward with these updates to get 1% better each day! ðŸ’ª
