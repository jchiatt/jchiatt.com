In [his talk "How to Get 1% Better Every Day,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_nzqnXWvSo&pp=ygUaMSBwZXJjZW50IGJldHRlciBldmVyeSBkYXk%3D) James Clear (Atomic Habits guy) mentions how a 1% improvement each day, over the course of a year assuming these improvements compounding, become a 37x improvement.

I like improvement!

I've seen firsthand how the little decisions matter every day. So many things I started doing years ago and continue to do today have had a very clear impact on my life, career, and personal growth.

I'm trying to be even more intentional about this with my side projects, especially since I tend to have lots of ideas and "irons in the fire" so to speak. So I've written a table on my whiteboard:

| Project             | 1% Better Today? | How? |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ---- |
| Learn Arena         |                  |      |
| DevLifts            |                  |      |
| Dev Career Coaching |                  |      |
| Grapple             |                  |      |
| rafl                |                  |      |
| Personal Brand      |                  |      |
| Self-Own            |                  |      |

Having it on the whiteboard is a constant reminder each day to make each thing 1% better. Then, I'm going to share the improvements here!

Let's see what these projects look like a year from now!
