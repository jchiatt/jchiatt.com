I've been posting daily [JavaScript challenges on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/JCsJSTips) lately, and today's challenge involves [re-implementing Array.map](https://twitter.com/jchiatt/status/1146034617646047233).

This is certainly not the only solution for this, but here's my stab at it.

<Image src={map} alt="" />

## What does Array.map do?

Full details can be found on the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), but here's the gist of things:

1. `.map` lives on the `Array` prototype
1. It returns a new Array from after calling a callback function on every element of the array on which you call it.
1. The callback function has 3 arguments, the last two of which are optional: the current item, the current index, and the original array you called `.map` on.
1. You can optionally pass in a second argument after the callback, which will be the `this` context to call the callback with. If you don't pass in a this context, the callback will be called with `undefined` as the `this` context.

## Example of Array.map

```javascript
const exercises = [
  "Bench Press", 
  "Svend Press", 
  "Chest Flyes",
  "Kettlebell Swing",
  "40 Yard Sprint",
];

const arr = exercises.map(item => {
  return "mapped " + item";
})

// returns:
[ 
  'mapped Bench Press',
  'mapped Svend Press',
  'mapped Chest Flyes',
  'mapped Kettlebell Swing',
  'mapped 40 Yard Sprint' 
]
```

## Re-implementing the method

### 1. Set up our function with the arguments we know it will take.

We know `map` accepts a callback and a `this` context. We also know that the `this` context will be set to `undefined` if one is not passed in, so we'll set a default value on that argument.

```javascript
function newMap(callback, thisArg = undefined) {
  // more code will go here
}
```

### 2. Exit early if there's a problem and give error messages.
First check is to make sure `newMap` was called on an array.

```javascript
function newMap(callback, thisArg = undefined) {
  // Ensure it called on an array.
  if (!Array.isArray(this)) {
    throw new TypeError('Must be called on an array');
  }
}
```

Next, make sure a callback was supplied since it is required.

```javascript
function newMap(callback, thisArg = undefined) {
  // Ensure it called on an array.
  if (!Array.isArray(this)) {
    throw new TypeError('Must be called on an array');
  }

  // Make sure a callback was supplied.
  if ( !callback ) {
    throw new TypeError('undefined is not a function');
  }
}
```

Lastly, make sure that _if_ a callback _was_ supplied, it is a function.

```javascript
function newMap(callback, thisArg = undefined) {
  // Ensure it called on an array.
  if (!Array.isArray(this)) {
    throw new TypeError('Must be called on an array');
  }

  // Ensure a callback was supplied.
  if ( !callback ) {
    throw new TypeError('undefined is not a function');
  }

  // Ensure the supplied callback is a function.
  if ( typeof callback !== 'function' ) {
    throw new TypeError(callback + " is not a function");
  }
}
```

### 3. Execute the callback for each item in the array.

```javascript
function newMap(callback, thisArg = undefined) {
  // Ensure it called on an array.
  if (!Array.isArray(this)) {
    throw new TypeError('Must be called on an array');
  }

  // Ensure a callback was supplied.
  if ( !callback ) {
    throw new TypeError('undefined is not a function');
  }

  // Ensure the supplied callback is a function.
  if ( typeof callback !== 'function' ) {
    throw new TypeError(callback + " is not a function");
  }

  /**
  * Make a copy of the original array, just in case the callback 
  * does any mutations on the current value.
  */
  const self = Array.from(this);

  // Initialize a new array to build and return.
  let newArray = [];

  // Loop through the length of the original array.
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    /**
    * Execute the callback with `thisArg` as the `this` context.
    * Callback is executed with 3 arguments:
    * self[i] is the current value
    * i is the current index
    * this is the original array
    */
    let result = callback.call(thisArg, self[i], i, this);

    // Add the result of the callback to the new array.
    newArray[i] = result;
  }

  // Return the new array.
  return newArray;
}
```

## Testing our new method.
We can attach our new method to the Array prototype and test it out like this:

```javascript
Array.prototype.newMap = newMap;

const arr = exercises.newMap(item => {
  return {% raw %}`new ${item}`{% endraw %};
})

// Returns the same result as Array.map
[ 
  'new Bench Press',
  'new Svend Press',
  'new Chest Flyes',
  'new Kettlebell Swing',
  'new 40 Yard Sprint' 
]
```
